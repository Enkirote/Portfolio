Responsive Layout: 
I opted for a responsive layout to ensure the gallery looks good and functions well on devices of all sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Work:
For this project  I made four HTML files, including the homepage.HTML, contact me.HTML, about me.HTML, projects.html, and I added around eight images to the folder.
Designs:
I used images as a part of the design in the project where each page has its own image as a background. For the homepage, I made sure to add a header which included the links to the other pages, which are :projects they contactme and aboutme. For the project.html I  used cards to show the projects as well as images. I also made sure to add buttons that would lead to the links of the projects. 
For the contact me.html are used text boxes that were responsive that allowed people to contact me using the emails. I also made sure to add a font family of “Courier new”.
Challenges
Cross-browser Compatibility: I tested the gallery on multiple browsers and used vendor prefixes where necessary to ensure broad compatibility.
Chosinng a design for my portfolio was also challenging
